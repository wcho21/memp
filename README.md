# MEMP

A sh-based memory profiler.

Why I made this: I couldn't find a simple memory profiler. (Any alternatives?)

## HOW TO USE

Copy the `memp.sh` file and make it executable (by running `chmod +x ./memp.sh`).

Example: to write the memory usage of `node` to `log` file, run:
```
./memp.sh node log
```

To exit, type `ctrl-c` as usual.
